## About Me

As you probably know by now, my name is Jens Johnson. I'm currently a software engineer at Nike, working remotely in 
the Denver, Colorado area.

I'm passionate about the intersection of technology, innovation, and collaborative 
project execution to create software solutions that deliver transformational results. My interests lie in the areas 
of data science, user experience and design, and service-driven architectures, and while I'm not cultivating these 
through the amazing work that I'm able to do at Nike, I love to explore them through my own side projects, which, 
lucky for you, are mostly captured here in my GitHub!

When I'm not engineering or working, I love to explore the outdoors through my passions of trail running, skiing, 
and hiking/camping, as well as enjoy all that Denver has to offer, from craft beer to an impressive local music scene.
